== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How Does It Work? =
 
Once you install and activate the plugin, the product prices will automatically be converted into site visitor local currency from USD and shown in brackets along side store price.
 
= So Does It Convert From USD Only? =
 
Yes the free version plugin base currency is USD only so it will convert from USD to whatever site visitor local currency is. However if you need to set any other base currency (your WooCommerce store has been set up in any currency other than USD), please upgrade to pro and the pro plugin will allow you to set base currency from out of 75+ currency choices.
